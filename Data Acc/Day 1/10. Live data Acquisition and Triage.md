Important concepts 
- Start your notes
- Test if the system is sleeping / hibernating
- Isolate from networks and communications
- Plug in your USB toolset to be minimally intrusive
- Image the RAM
- Check for any system protection
- Optionally perform Triage
- Perform logical image acquisition of the partitions

**Triage**
Getting the 1-2% of critical data is extremely important to the investigation
- Browser history
- Prefetch
- Registry hives
- Jump lists
- Email
- Lnk files
- file system

We can utilise FTK imager and AD1 containers, or KAPE/GKAPE

**Software Imaging**
The last step of the acquisition task ... only the logical (active) drives
	**Physical drives**
- The entire contents of disk
- May be inaccessible due to system protection
- Not a live drive
	**Logical Drives**
- Primary, Extended, and Logical Partitions
- Mounted to a letter in windows, like the C:\\ drive
- Live, with operations and functions usually running
- Can be fully accessible, as the system protection has been removed in order to have a user logged in
