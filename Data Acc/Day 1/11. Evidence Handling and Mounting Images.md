Mounting is done via the OS or by software

**Evidence Handling**
As We have guarantee'd the integrity of the data by hashes, we want to ensure the integrity of the data stays intact

We can do this by ...
- Make multiple copies of the data if possible
- Not performing any analysis or actions on the data, other than hashing and encrypting the disk
- Pack it so that it's safe from transport damage
- May require SAFEHAND, depending on the clearance
- Uploading the data to the backup storage
- Making a working copy of the data
- only performing conversions and analysis on copies
