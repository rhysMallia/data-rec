When the system does not contain a full packet capture, or the incident is still active, you may want to put in a TAP or SPAN port to capture evidence

SPAN 
Performs mirroring of all data from one port to another
- line in the firewall

In-line TAP
physical device which captures dataa 

Implementing full packet capture will affect the technical governance requirements of the supported mission owner and system owner 

**SPAN vs TAP**
Tap does not distort or drop packets, regardless of bandwidth, while span drops packets when the port is over subscribed

TAP has no IP or MAC, if it has an IP it could be hacked

TAP does not alter the time relationship of frames, spacing,  or response times, while SPAN can distort realtime comms like video calls

**Types of TAPs**
Active
- Requires their own power to regenerate the signals
- Recieves packets and then retransimts to both the network and monitoring destionations

Passive
- No power, does not actively interact with other components of the network
- An optical splitter which creates a copy of the signal (photonic tap)
- Usually has no moving parts


**Split ratios**
Regardless of method, the passive spliiyer physically diverts a portion of the light from its original source

The proportional share of light for each path is known as the split ratio, and it always equals 100

**Virtual Captures**
Traffic between virtual servers is commonly refered to as east west traffic
- Software based version of a network tap is configured to capture the intra virtual machines traffic which is sent to monitoring tools

**Tap Installation**
1. Understand how much loss light loss to preserve proper light margins
2. Placing the tap on a shelf or rack
3. Connecting the cables
4. Verification that it's working

**When are active taps preferred**
- Locations where the light levels are tooo low to use a splitter -> regeneration
- Copper infrastructures whree electricity is used to move elections (no photons)

**storage requirements**
May need high performance drives, or RAID controllers with a write cache
