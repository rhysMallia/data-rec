'To get a forensically sound copy of al the data we need for an investigation'
- Reliable and maintainable

Acquired in a forensically sound manner, using forensically sound tools
	- Original needs to be the same as the copy
	- Minimum changes to data / meta data
	- more difficult as OS' increase complexity and storage levels increase

We need to get the image (whole or part) to a clean destination drive with as little disturbance as possible!
