**Image types**
- DD/RAW
	- Covert and copy - Bit for bit image of the source
		- Large file, slow, but convenient as almost all tools work
- E01
	- Encase image format - Compresses and can divide images
		- Not all tools work with E01, but many do nowadays
- AFF4
	- Advanced forensics format - lots of fancy stuff
		- Disks of any size, multiple formats, open source, can image newer macs with M2 chips

Types of containers
- AD1 / L01 - FTK imager prop format
- VHD / VHDx - Virtual hard disk / Hyper V virtual HD

**Hashes and SSD complications**
A hash is taken of the entire drive to verify if an image was successfully taken
- MD5 / SHA1 (older)
- SHA256

As SSDs differ from HDDs, wear levelling may move data around to spare writes on chips
- Garbage collection -> moving data to new locations and allowing data to be rewritten
- TRIM -> used by the OS, may happen if the disk is being used as the destionation drive (power on)
- Disk damage -> erosion, damage or mech failure the data will also be changed

If the hash doesn't match, do it again
